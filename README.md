consult the oracle digitally without having to cast physical stalks or to flip coins; save you questions and the responses

the I Ching is an ancient chinese divination text

the I Ching is a long-loved (has been used and refined over 4,000 years) tool of self-examination and decision making; part of the joy of the book is that the divination ritual requires and time and focus, but sometimes an individual might wish to ask a question quickly or while on the go; additionally, a questioner might wish to consult the I Ching at a time when they do not have yarrow stalks or coins handy to consult the oracle or when they do not have pen and paper handy to record and meditate on the result
